When I have surplus bees I sell 5 frame nucleus colonies - including overwintered nucs - and queens. Sales are 'collection only' from St Andrews in Fife. I rear all my own queens locally, selected from my best stocks and 'open mated' in May and June (for current year nucs) or in midsummer the previous year (for overwintered nucs).

The bees are local mongrels, not Buckfast, or native blacks, or carniolans, and are all the better for it. They have been selected for their good behaviour and hard work. Many beginners have enjoyed successfully starting beekeeping with these bees. They generally only need a single brood box hive and are reasonably frugal with stores overwinter.

The stocks from which they were raised have low *Varroa* and virus levels, but I make no claims about their being *Varroa* resistant or tolerant (and if others you see being sold come with these claims I'd ask to see the evidence!). Parental stocks are treated in mid-August and early winter to minimise mite levels, and this is usually sufficient for the entire season. 

### Current availability:
