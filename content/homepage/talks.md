I give online talks between September and March on a wide range of beekeeping topics including queen rearing, DIY for beekeepers and rational *Varroa* control. The majority of the talks include a little bit of lightweight science (I'm a retired academic and studied viruses, including those of honey bees, for three decades) and lots of practical beekeeping. 

The talk topics are regularly reviewed, added to  and updated. A full list of available talks, the fees and my availability are on my [beekeeping talks site](https://talks.theapiarist.org).
