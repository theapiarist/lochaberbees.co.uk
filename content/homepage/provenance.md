**provenance** (noun) - *"geographic source or place of origin"*.

Further general details of my honey are available from the [Lochaber Bees & Honey site](https://lochaberbees.co.uk/#honey).

My honey is extracted and carefully stored until jarring. It is only jarred to order, in batches of no more than ~30 jars, all originally harvested from the same location and at the same time. Each jar carries a unique batch number enabling the purchaser to trace the provenance of the honey, from the apairy to the table.

If you have a jar of either my *Collessie* or *St Andrews* honey and want to know more about it then check the label and enter the unique 5 character batch number below.
