Welcome to Lochaber Bees and Honey. I keep bees in Scotland, producing honey for sale in select cafe's, farm shops and other artisinal outlets that specialise in high quality local produce. I also rear calm and productive bees and queens in Fife that are sometimes for sale to local beekeepers. 

Scotland has a relatively short beekeeping season because of its latitude. In our long winters I give [talks](https://talks.theapiarist.org) on bees, science and beekeeping. I also write extensively about beekeeping in my weekly 'blog', [The Apiarist](https://theapiarist.org).

I hope you find what you are looking for here.
