I write the weekly beekeeping blog [The Apiarist](https://theapiarist.org). The posts cover an eclectic range of topics including the principles and practice of beekeeping, starting beekeeping, DIY for beekeepers, waspkeeping (!), equipment, queen rearing, disease management and the science and biology of honey bees and sustainable beekeeping.

If there is not something this week that interests you, there might well be next week. Readers can subscribe to receive notifications of new posts by email (which *should* appear on Friday afternoons if I'm not busy with my bees), but are also announced on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/The_Apiarist), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/davidtheapiarist/) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.scot/@theapiarist).
