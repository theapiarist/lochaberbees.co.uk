Thank you for buying a jar of local St Andrews spring honey

My St Andrews bees forage over the rich agricultural land of east Fife, the windswept  furze of the golf courses and the flower-filled gardens of St Andrews. Although they can forage up to three miles from the hive, they usually stay closer to home.

Spring honey contains nectars from early agricultural crops, like oil seed rape (canola), mixed with whatever is available in the hedgerows and field margins. Depending upon the year it may also contain tree nectars from hawthorn and sycamore. The gardens in the town contain an eclectic mix of flowering plants and shrubs, any or all of which may end up in the honey. 

The timing and relative proportions of each nectar vary from colony to colony and from year to year, making each batch of honey unique, a delicious snapshot of a particular time and place to be enjoyed with porridge, toast, cheese or ice cream.

Spring honey crystallises very quickly after extraction due to its high glucose content. Without some gentle processing it bends teaspoons (but still tastes delicious). The honey is gently warmed and then mixed over several days to create a smooth, spoonable honey termed 'soft set' or 'creamed' honey. It is particularly good on toast or crumpets. Since this honey is already crystallised its appearance and texture should remain similar until you finish the jar.
