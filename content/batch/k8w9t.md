Thank you for buying a jar of Ardnamurchan honey

My Ardnamurchan bees forage over the rough moorland on the south-facing slopes of the remote Ardnamurchan peninsula. This area has no arable farming and is sparsely populated. Although they can forage up to three miles from the hive, they usually stay closer to home.

There is a single honey harvest, in late summer, and so the flavour of the honey reflects the forage available from mid-July to early September. The predominant nectar is from heather (ling) which gives the honey a distinctive appearance and flavour. However, at the same time there will be flowering blackberry, gorse and a variety of other plants and trees, and the bees will take advantage of whatever is available. The weather - often changeable - can influence both nectar availability and the ability of the bees to access it, so honey can vary from season to season. 

The honey is [extacted using a fruit press](https://theapiarist.org/under-pressure-the-speidel-hydropress/), and is never warmed higher than the temperature of the hive (~35Â°C), thereby ensuring that the full flavour is retained from comb to jar. 

Whatever the precise blend of nectars, it is always absolutely delicious. Each batch of honey unique, a mouth-watering snapshot of a particular time and place to be enjoyed with porridge, toast, cheese or ice cream. 

It is the perfect gift, or a wonderfully self-indulgent treat.
